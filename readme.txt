################################################################ SWFbox v1.1#### Created by: Makis T. (makis@makesites.cc)## URL: http://www.makesites.cc/programming/by-makis/swfbox/##############################################################Description: ============SWFbox is a lightweight JavaScript file to present flash files as pop-ups on a page, pretty much like Lightbox does for images. Each SWFbox is dependent only by the id of the parent div (the swfName variable). That way you can have more than one SWFboxes in any page. Contents: =========readme.txt 			- This text fileswfbox.css 			- The styles for the SWFbox divsswfbox.js 			- The core application fileexample.html 		- An example file to see the code in actionexample.swf 		- a flash file used in the example.html pageUsage: ======1. Copy the "swfbox.js", "swfbox.css" files from the archive to your website folder. 2. Link to the files with HTML <script> and <link> tags in your <head> section (Copy the code from the "example.html" file if you want)3. Create the links for your swfboxes in your body code. These must have the following structure: <a href="http://www.domain.com/.../flash.swf" onclick="SWFbox('swfName','swfWidth','swfHeight','#FFFFFF', this.href); return false;">...</a>Remember to change the following:  - "http://www.domain.com/.../flash.swf" is the actual URL of your flash file. - "swfName" is the id of the parent div of an SWFbox. - "swfWidth" is the width of your flash file (ex. 600) - "swfHeight" is the height of your flash file (ex. 400) - "#FFFFFF" is the background color of your flash file.4. Load up your page and let SWFbox handle the rest ;) Disclaimer: ===========THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
