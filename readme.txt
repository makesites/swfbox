################################################################ SWFbox v1.0#### Created by: Makis T. (makis@makesites.cc)## URL: http://www.makesites.cc/programming/by-makis/swfbox/##############################################################Description: ============SWFbox is a lightweight javaScript file to present flash files as pop-ups on a page, pretty much like Lightbox does for images. Theoretically the content div can be used to load any HTML content. But that's beyond my needs at this time. Contents: =========readme.txt 			- This text fileswfbox.css 			- The styles for the SWFbox divsexample.html 		- An example file to see the code in actionswfbox.js 			- The core application fileswfobject.js 		- The SWFObject library to load the flash (not mandatory)example.swf 		- a flash file to use on the example.html pageUsage: ======1. Copy the "swfbox.js", "swfbox.css" files from the archive to your website folder. 2. Link to the files with HTML <script> and <link> tags in your <head> section (Copy the code from the "example.html" file if you want)3. Optionally you can use the "swfobject.js" (also included in the archive), to avoid writing <object> and <embed> codes for the flash. 4. Create the swfboxes in your body code. The basic structure for an SWFbox is as follows: <div id="swfbox001" style="display: none;"> <div class="swfbox-container">  <div class="swfbox-content">    Your Flash here...  </div> </div> <div class="swfbox-back"></div><script type="text/javascript">hideActions('swfbox001');</script></div>Each SWFbox is dependent only by the id of the parent div (swfbox001 in my example). That way you can copy-paste the code and have more than one swfboxes in the same page, just by changing the name in the id of the parent div and the hideActions function. 5. Load an SWFbox with the following link: <a href="javascript:swfboxShow('swfwidth','swfheight','swfbox001');">see my flash</a>, where - "swfwidth" is the width of your flash file (ex. 600) - "swfheight" is the height of your flash file (ex. 400) - "swfbox001" is the id of the parent div of the SWFbox.  Disclaimer: ===========THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
